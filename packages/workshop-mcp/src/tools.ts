Sets the playground environment so the user can continue to that exercise or see

NOTE: this will override their current exercise step work in the playground!

Generally, it is better to not provide an exerciseNumber, stepNumber, and type
and let the user continue to the next exercise. Only provide these arguments if
the user explicitely asks to go to a specific exercise or step. If the user asks
to start an exercise, specify stepNumber 1 and type 'problem' unless otherwise
directed.

Argument examples:
A. If logged in and there is an incomplete exercise step, set to next incomplete exercise step based on the user's progress - Most common
	- [No arguments]
B. If not logged in or all exercises are complete, set to next exercise step from current (or first if there is none)
	- [No arguments]
C. Set to a specific exercise step
	- exerciseNumber: 1
	- stepNumber: 1
	- type: 'solution'
D. Set to the solution of the current exercise step
	- type: 'solution'
E. Set to the second step problem of the current exercise
	- stepNumber: 2
F. Set to the first step problem of the fifth exercise
	- exerciseNumber: 5

An error will be returned if no app is found for the given arguments.

required behavior, API, or user experience. If the differences are only
stylistic or organizational, explain that things look different, but they are
still valid and ready to be tested.

elaborate.
