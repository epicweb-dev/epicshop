[2025-10-23T00:00:00Z] Bun migration started

Plan:
- Assess repo scripts and Node assumptions
- Install Bun runtime
- Install dependencies with Bun at repo root (will trigger example postinstall via npm)
- Build packages with Bun in dependency order: workshop-utils → workshop-presence → workshop-app → workshop-cli
- Run targeted tests with Bun (workshop-utils)
- Provide commands to run dev server with Bun (cannot run long-lived dev server here)

Notes:
- Keep Node available for CLI and server runtime; focus on using Bun for install/run.
- Log each action and outcome here.

[2025-10-23T00:05:00Z] Installed Bun version 1.3.1
[2025-10-23T00:07:00Z] bun install completed at repo root; example postinstall executed via npm
[2025-10-23T00:12:00Z] Built packages with Bun: workshop-utils, workshop-presence, workshop-app, workshop-cli
[2025-10-23T00:14:00Z] bun test failed in workshop-utils (vi.mocked not supported); switch to vitest via bunx
[2025-10-23T00:16:00Z] bunx vitest run succeeded in workshop-utils, workshop-cli, workshop-presence, workshop-mcp
[2025-10-23T00:22:00Z] Updated CI workflow validate.yml to install Bun (oven-sh/setup-bun@v2) and use bun install in all jobs to prevent "/bin/sh: 1: bun: not found" errors.
