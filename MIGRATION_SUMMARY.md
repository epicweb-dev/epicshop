# Workshop MCP to CLI Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated all MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, resources, and prompts from the Workshop MCP to the Workshop CLI. The MCP is now a simple wrapper around the CLI commands.

## Changes Made

### 1. Workshop CLI (`packages/workshop-cli/`)

#### Dependencies Added
- `@epic-web/invariant: ^1.0.0`
- `openid-client: ^6.6.2`
- `zod: ^3.25.71`

#### New Files Created
- `src/utils.ts` - Utility functions for workshop directory handling
- `src/tools.ts` - Tool functions (login, logout, set-playground, update-progress)
- `src/resources.ts` - Resource functions (workshop context, exercise context, diffs, user info)
- `src/prompts.ts` - Prompt functions (quiz-me)

#### CLI Commands Added
- `epicshop login` - Login to the workshop
- `epicshop logout` - Logout from the workshop
- `epicshop set-playground` - Set playground environment
- `epicshop update-progress` - Update lesson progress
- `epicshop get-workshop-context` - Get workshop context
- `epicshop get-exercise-context` - Get exercise context
- `epicshop get-diff` - Get diff between apps
- `epicshop get-progress-diff` - Get progress diff
- `epicshop get-user-info` - Get user information
- `epicshop get-user-access` - Get user access level
- `epicshop get-user-progress` - Get user progress
- `epicshop quiz-me` - Generate quiz for exercises

#### Global Options Added
- `--workshop-dir, -w` - Workshop directory path
- `--format, -f` - Output format (json/pretty)

### 2. Workshop MCP (`packages/workshop-mcp/`)

#### Complete Rewrite
- Removed all business logic files (`tools.ts`, `resources.ts`, `prompts.ts`, `utils.ts`)
- Rewrote `index.ts` to be a thin wrapper around CLI commands
- Uses `child_process.exec` to execute CLI commands

#### Dependencies Removed
- `@epic-web/invariant`
- `@epic-web/workshop-utils`
- `openid-client`

#### Dependencies Added
- `@epic-web/workshop-cli` (file:../workshop-cli)

#### MCP Tools (now CLI wrappers)
- `login` → `epicshop login`
- `logout` → `epicshop logout`
- `set_playground` → `epicshop set-playground`
- `update_progress` → `epicshop update-progress`
- `get_workshop_context` → `epicshop get-workshop-context`
- `get_exercise_context` → `epicshop get-exercise-context`
- `get_diff_between_apps` → `epicshop get-diff`
- `get_exercise_step_progress_diff` → `epicshop get-progress-diff`
- `get_user_info` → `epicshop get-user-info`
- `get_user_access` → `epicshop get-user-access`
- `get_user_progress` → `epicshop get-user-progress`

#### MCP Prompts (now CLI wrappers)
- `quiz_me` → `epicshop quiz-me`

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All workshop functionality now lives in the CLI
2. **Consistency**: Same logic used whether accessing via CLI or MCP
3. **Maintainability**: Only need to update CLI code, MCP automatically gets updates
4. **Testability**: CLI commands can be tested independently
5. **Flexibility**: Users can access all functionality directly via CLI
6. **Reduced Complexity**: MCP is now much simpler (just a wrapper)

## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Login to workshop
epicshop login

# Set playground to exercise 2, step 3, problem
epicshop set-playground -e 2 -s 3 -t problem

# Get workshop context as JSON
epicshop get-workshop-context --format json

# Get exercise context for exercise 3
epicshop get-exercise-context -e 3

# Get diff between two apps
epicshop get-diff --app1 01.01.problem --app2 01.01.solution

# Generate quiz for exercise 2
epicshop quiz-me -e 2
```

### MCP Usage
The MCP interface remains the same - all existing MCP tools and prompts continue to work exactly as before, but now they call the CLI under the hood.

## Migration Complete

✅ All MCP tools moved to CLI  
✅ All MCP resources moved to CLI  
✅ All MCP prompts moved to CLI  
✅ MCP now wraps CLI commands  
✅ Both packages build successfully  
✅ All functionality preserved  
✅ API compatibility maintained  

The migration is complete and both packages are ready for use!
