# Export App

In this exercise, you'll learn about the Export App type. Export apps are a
special type of simple app that:

1. **Capture console output** - All `console.log`, `console.warn`,
   `console.error`, `console.info`, and `console.debug` calls are displayed in
   the UI
2. **Display exports** - Named exports from your `index.js` or `index.ts` file
   are automatically pretty-printed in the UI

This is particularly useful for exercises where you want students to see the
results of their code without needing to manipulate the DOM directly.
