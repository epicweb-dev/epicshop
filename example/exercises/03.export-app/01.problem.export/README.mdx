# Export App

👨‍💼 In this exercise, you need to implement a function that processes an array of
numbers.

🐨 Export a function called `doubleNumbers` that takes an array of numbers and
returns a new array with each number doubled.

🐨 Also export a variable called `result` that contains the result of calling
`doubleNumbers` with the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

💰 Use `console.log` to show the input and output. The console output will be
displayed in the preview panel!
