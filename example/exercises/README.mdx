<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/welcome-to-the-epic-workshop-app-tutorial-ryfkh" />

👨‍💼 Welcome to the Epic Workshop App Tutorial! My name is Peter the Product
Manager! My job is to communicate user requirements to you as you work through
workshop exercises. My goal is to help you understand how what you're learning
is applicable to real-world problems.

In Epic Workshops, this is the homepage and it will give you an overview of what
to expect to learn in the workshop.

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the features of the app to make sure you're
aware of what is available to help you learn and succeed in the workshop. And
we'll be using the workshop app itself to do it!

🐨 My name is Kody the Koala. Any time you see me, it's because I'm telling you
specific instructions on what you should be doing.

## Navigation

🐨 Click on the "hamburger" icon in the top left of the page.

This opens a sidebar. Next to the close button is the title of the workshop.
Clicking that will bring you back to this page.

## Logging In

If you're not already logged in, you'll see a banner at the top of the page that
links you to <Link to="/login">`/login`</Link>.

🐨 Click the "Login" link and follow the instructions to authorize your computer
to access your account data.

Once you're done with that, come back here using the sidebar navigation and
we'll continue.

## Navigation (continued)

🐨 If the navigation sidebar is not visible, click the "hamburger" menu icon in
the top left of the page.

Now that you're logged in, the sidebar will show not only the exercises, but
also the people who are currently also using the Workshop App, your progress,
and a link to your account page.

On the account page, you'll find links to manage your account and preferences.

🐨 Explore the account and preferences pages then come back here.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The Workshop app has keyboard shortcuts for many actions you can take. Simply
press the <kbd>?</kbd> key on your keyboard to open the keyboard shortcuts modal.

🐨 Explore the keyboard shortcuts.

## Exercises

Ok, now let's get into the exercises.
