# No Preview

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/apps-without-preview-problem-pizqr" />

👨‍💼 Some apps don't have a `dev` script in the `package.json` because they don't
actually run and you're instead expected to run the app manually.

You'll notice we also don't have a preview for the problem and solution either
for the same reason, so those tabs won't appear.

Incidentally, this exercise also does not have a `test` script so there is no
Test tab either.

🐨 Open a terminal into the `./playground` directory and run `node greet.js` to
see what it outputs.

🐨 Continue to the solution for this step.
