# Simple Apps

👨‍💼 Some apps are so simple they don't even have a `package.json` file. Instead
they just have an index file which is automatically opened in the playground.

If an `index.html` is present, that's what gets rendered. Otherwise, one is
created automatically and `index.js` (or `index.ts`) is loaded into it. Even
`index.css` will be loaded.

These also can have tests as well, and they run automatically when you open the
Test tab.

🐨 Go ahead and complete this exercise. Notice how the playground directory only
has a single file in it.
