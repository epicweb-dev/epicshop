# MDX feature playground (solution)

This solution exists mainly so the **diff viewer** has something to show.

## Quick links

<PrevDiffLink>Preview the previous diff</PrevDiffLink>
<NextDiffLink>Preview the next diff</NextDiffLink>

You can also link to a full-page diff:

<DiffLink fullPage app1="03/01.problem" app2="03/01.solution">
  Open fullscreen diff: <code>03/01.problem</code> → <code>03/01.solution</code>
</DiffLink>

## A second callout (to verify rendering changes)

<callout-info>
If you can see this callout and the diff links work, the MDX feature exercise is
doing its job.
