# First Exercise Step

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/your-first-exercise-step-problem-winqy" />

👨‍💼 This is the exercise step page and this is where I (Peter the Product
Manager) will help you understand the problem you need to solve. I'll frame it
from the perspective of the user so you can gain a practical understanding of
the topic this exercise is covering.

There will often be a video, diagrams, and code examples, and other resources
to aid you in understanding and solving the problem.

## 🛝 The Playground Directory

Each exercise has a set of files you'll be working in. These files are located
in the `./playground` directory of your repository.

<callout-success class="important">
	You should only ever change files in the `./playground` directory.
</callout-success>

The workshop app will keep your `./playground` directory updated for each
exercise step, however you do have to **manually set the playground** when you
start each step (this is manual to avoid accidentally overwriting your work).

🐨 Click the button at the top of the page that says "Set to Playground". When
you do this, the workshop app copies the files from
`./exercises/01.exercise-navigation/01.problem.first-step` into your
`./playground` directory.

🐨 Click the button at the bottom of the page that says "Files". This will open
a popover that lists the files you'll be working with in this exercise.

🐨 Click the `index.js` file in the Files popover. This will open it in your editor.

<details>
<summary>Click here if your preferred editor does not open when clicking a file</summary>

### Explicitly set the editor to use

If you are unable to open file links from the workshop app, create a `.env` file
in the root of this project and add an environment variable called
`EPICSHOP_EDITOR` with the value being set to the path to your editor's
executable. For example, if you're using VS Code on Windows, you'd add this to
your .env file:

```sh
EPICSHOP_EDITOR='"C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin\code.cmd"'
```

Make certain that if the path includes spaces that you wrap the path in quotes
as above (note the use of single quotes wrapping the double quotes!).

The value of `EPICSHOP_EDITOR` should be the command that you would run in your
terminal to open your editor from the command line. This means, the first thing
should be the path to the executable for your editor (or the command if you have
one in your `PATH`). So you may be able to get away with doing something as
simple as this: `EPICSHOP_EDITOR=code`

If you're working with VSCode or similar, you have another option. You can
accomplish this by accessing the Command Palette
(using the shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> on Windows)
and entering "shell command". You may want to consider uninstalling it first and
then proceed to "Install 'code' command in PATH".

### How we determine the correct editor to open

If you'r curious, here's the logic we use to determine the correct editor to open:

The editor selection algorithm uses a priority cascade. It first checks the
`EPICSHOP_EDITOR` environment variable; if set, it uses that. Otherwise, it
detects running editors by scanning active processes: on macOS it runs `ps x`
and matches against a map of common editor process paths; on Windows it uses
`wmic` when available (with a PowerShell `Get-Process` fallback) to list
processes and checks executable names against a whitelist; on Linux it uses
`ps x` with process name filtering. The first matching editor from
the platform-specific list is selected.

If no running editor is detected, the algorithm falls back to the `VISUAL`
environment variable, then `EDITOR`. If none of these yield a valid editor, it
returns `null`, which causes the launch function to return an error. This
approach prioritizes explicit configuration, then auto-detection of running
editors, and finally standard environment variables, ensuring compatibility
across development environments while allowing manual override.

## Tabs

On the right side of this page, you'll see several tabs:

### 🛝 Playground

This is the primary tab you'll be using to complete the exercise. At the top,
it shows a dropdown which allows you to set the playground to any other app in
the workshop (both the problem and solution apps).

Next to that you'll see an icon which is either a pulsing broken link or a solid
link. If it's pulsing, that means the playground you're looking at is different
from the exercise step you're on. Clicking the icon will update your playground
to the correct app for this exercise step.

🐨 Click the "Start App" button in the playground tab.

This runs the `dev` script defined in the `./playground/package.json` and
displays the output in an iframe in the playground tab.

There is some limited forward/backward navigation, URL navigation, and refresh
functionality, but if you really need to use these features, I recommend you
click the "Open in New Tab" button next to the "Stop App" button and you'll get
a new tab with the playground app running.

🐨 Click the "Stop App" button in the playground tab. Then click the "Start App"
button again. This will restart the app and may be necessary sometimes when you
make changes to the playground files.

<callout-info class="aside">
	You can hold down the <kbd>⌥</kbd> (or <kbd>Alt</kbd> key) key to change "Stop
	App" to "Restart App" to restart the app without having to click the start
	button again.
</callout-info>

### Problem/Solution Tabs

These two tabs are similar to the playground tab, but they show the problem and
solution apps for the exercise step you're on. This is useful if you want to
review the before/after state of the workshop's version of the app to understand
the changes you've made and how they compare to your own solution.

### Tests Tab

Some exercises will have tests that you can run to verify your solution.

🐨 Click the run tests button (the "Play" icon) in the tests tab.

This runs the `test` script defined in the `./playground/package.json` and
displays the terminal output.

<callout-warning class="aside">
	Keep in mind the tests are imperfect. You may have a correct solution and
	failing tests or vice versa.
</callout-warning>

🚨 I'm Alfred the Alert. I'll often be in the terminal output to give you
specific pointers on why your tests are failing.

If this tab does not show up, it's because the exercise step does not have any
tests.

### Diff Tab

🐨 Click the "Diff" tab.

If you get stuck, you can click the "Diff" tab to see the difference between
your playground work in progress and the workshop's version of the solution.

The diff tab should update automatically, but if it doesn't, you can click the
"Refresh" icon to force a refresh.

You can also select the apps you want to compare. This can be helpful if you
want to compare the problem to your playground to see the changes you've made
so far.

### Chat Tab

The Chat tab will show you a window into the relevant Discord channel for this
workshop. You can see and open threads from other students and start your own.
Clicking the discord icon on a thread will open that thread in the discord app
on your machine. Clicking the "Open in Browser" icon will open that thread in
your web browser (useful if you don't have the discord app installed).

## Making code changes

Ok, now you have a good understanding of the tools to help you complete the
task, it's time to actually make code changes.

🐨 You can either click the "Files" button below to open `index.js` or click
this: <InlineFile file="./index.js" /> then follow the instructions in the file
to complete the task.

🐨 Then run the playground app to see your changes in action and verify they're
working as expected with the tests. Then you can compare your changes using the
diff tab.

## Talk with the workshop using your AI agent

If you have an agent that supports MCP, you can install the Epic Workshop MCP
server and talk with the workshop using your agent. Here's what your AI agent
can help you with:

### Workshop Navigation & Progress

- **Get what's next** - Determine the next step you should take (login, watch video, complete exercise, etc.)
- **Set playground** - Move you to a specific exercise/step or advance to the next one
- **Open exercise files** - Open the relevant files for the current exercise step in your editor
- **Get workshop context** - Overview of all topics covered in the workshop
- **Get exercise context** - Detailed instructions and transcripts for a specific exercise
- **Get exercise step context** - Instructions and transcripts for a specific exercise step

### Progress Tracking

- **Update progress** - Mark lessons as complete or incomplete
- **Get user progress** - See which exercises you've completed and what's remaining
- **Get progress diff** - Show what work remains between your current code and the solution

### User Management

- **Login/Logout** - Authenticate with the workshop
- **Get user info** - View your account details
- **Get user access** - Check if you have paid features (transcripts, videos, Discord, etc.)

### Learning Tools

- **Get quiz instructions** - Generate quizzes on workshop topics to test your knowledge
- **Get diff between apps** - Compare any two exercise steps to see the differences

Your AI agent can start by asking what's next, which automatically handles
figuring out if you need to login, watch a video, or work on an exercise. Then
it can help you understand the instructions, show progress diffs, make code
changes, and mark items complete.

## Solution

Great, now that you've finished the exercise step, you can click the "Next"
button below (the arrow icons at the bottom of the page do the same thing).

🐨 Click the "Next" button below (or the right arrow icon).
