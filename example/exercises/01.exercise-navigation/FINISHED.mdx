At the end of each exercise you will see the finished page like this one. This
will sometimes give you a summary of what you've learned. The primary purpose of
this page though is to give you an opportunity to reflect on what you've learned
to solidify your understanding.

On the right, there is a form you can fill out which asks you to restate in your
own words what you've learned as well as provide feedback on the exercise to
make it better for future students.

If there were more exercises after this one, clicking the right arrow icon below
would take you to the next exercise. Instead, it'll take you to the last page.

🐨 Submit the form, then click the right arrow icon below.
