# Multi-Step Exercise

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/working-with-multi-step-exercises-problem-679x5" />

👨‍💼 Lots of exercises will have multiple steps. The only thing you need to know
about this is on each step you need to click the "Set to Playground" button
above when you're ready to start working on the step.

## Changes between steps

Often steps build upon each other. But sometimes there can be significant
changes between them. This is often because the instructor wants to handle
"busywork" for you. When that happens, you can check the "Diff" tab to see the
difference between the solution of the previous step and the problem of the
current step.

🧝‍♀️ Hi, I'm Kellie the Co-worker. When there are significant changes between
steps, I'll often show up to tell you what I've changed and give a link to look
at the changes.

For example, in this step we're building upon the HTTP server by serving HTML
instead of just text. You can <PrevDiffLink>check the diff here</PrevDiffLink>
if you're curious.

🐨 Click the link in the previous paragraph and notice the diff apps are set to
the previous solution and the current problem.

## Preserving the Playground

🐨 Click "Set to Playground" to get your playground updated for this step.

One important thing to note is that the playground directory is completely blown
away each time you click "Set to Playground". This is to ensure you're always
working with the latest files and to avoid any confusion about which files you're
working with.

<summary>Can I save my work in progress?</summary>

You can always set the playground to any other app in the workshop, but if you'd
like to save your work to reference it later, you can
open <Link to="/preferences">`/preferences`</Link> and enable the
"Persist Playground" option. This will move your playground directory to a
`./saved-playgrounds` directory before overwriting it with the latest files so
you can reference your work later.
