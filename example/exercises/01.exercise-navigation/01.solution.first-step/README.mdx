👨‍💼 Great job! You've made it to the solution portion of the first exercise step!
On this page, you'll often find a video, diagrams, and code examples, and other
resources that will help you understand how the instructor solved the problem.

Everything else is the same as the problem. You can still play with the
playground app, open files in the playground, check the diff, etc.
